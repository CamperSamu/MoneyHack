# Money Hack
> R1, R2, L1, X, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP!

Utility stuff for Gunpowder's Currency module.
For now this mod only adds a couple of extra commands to [Gunpowder Currency](https://github.com/gunpowder-mc/gunpowdercurrency) to edit a player's balance from console, but I might add more in the future.
### Why can't you just open a pr?

## Commands and Permissions
